# README for sc-miReg

This Github repository stores files for **Analysis of miRNA Regulation in Single Cells**, maintained by Wendao Liu (liuwd15@tsinghua.org.cn).

The analysis workflow, along with all results, are shown in this [vignette](https://nshomron.github.io/sc-miReg/). **Please view this vignette first.**

If you want to run the workflow on your own device, we provide a [R script](https://github.com/nshomron/sc-miReg/blob/master/microRNA%20regulation%20in%20single%20cells.R) that can be run in any R console, and a [notebook](https://github.com/nshomron/sc-miReg/blob/master/microRNA%20regulation%20in%20single%20cells.ipynb) that can be run in Jupyter notebook.

Data files are available in the [data directory](https://github.com/nshomron/sc-miReg/tree/master/data).
